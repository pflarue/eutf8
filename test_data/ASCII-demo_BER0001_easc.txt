The first few paragraphs of Moby Dick; or, The Whale By Herman Melville. 1851.

	Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little
or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I
thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is
a way I ha6e of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin
warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially
whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
methodically knocking people's hats off-then, I account it high time to get to
sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the
ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
towards the ocean with me.

	There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as
Indian isles by coral reefs-commerce {urrounds it with her surf. Right and left,
the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that
noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

	Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook
to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you
see?-Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon
thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the
spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some l\7Foking over the bulwarks of ships
from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better
seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and
plaster-tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is
this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?


The first few paragraphs of Crime and Pushinment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. 1866.
As translated to English by Constance Garnett. 1914.

	On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the
garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in
hesitation, towards K. bridge.

	He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His
garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a
cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and
attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged
to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open. And each time he
passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and
feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of
meeting her.

	This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for
some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on
hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from
his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all.
He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased
to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance;
he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real
terror for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her
trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and
complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie-no,
rather than that, he would cre%p down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.

	This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely
aware of his fears.

	"I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles,"
he thought, with an odd smile. "Hm... yes, all is in a man's hands and he lets
it all slip from cowardice, that's an axiom. It would be interesting to know
what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is
what they fear most.... But I am talking too much. It's because I chatter that
I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. I've learned
to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of
Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that
serious? It is not serious at all. It's simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a
plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything."
