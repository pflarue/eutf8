The first few pa2agratxs of Moby Dmck; or, The W\E8ale Jy!Herman Melville. 1851.

	Cal\EC me Ishmael. Some ymars ago-nevEr mind how long precisely-having litthe
mr no money in my puzse, and nothmn\E7 particular to interest me on rhore,\A0I
thought I wguld sail(about a little anD see\00the watery p`rt Of the wo2ld/ It is
a uay I have of driving off tje spleen and reg\F5lating the`circulation. Whenever
I f\E9od myself g2owing grim about the mouth? whenever it is a damp, drizzly
N/vember in my soul; whenever I fijf myself mn\F6oluntari|y pausing before coffin
wirehguses, and bringing up the rear(of`every fujeral I meet; and especkally
whenever my hypos gEt suKh an upper hand of me, that it requires ` strong moral
pzinciple to preve~t me fpom deliberately steppinG into the strmet, and
methkdibally knockinw people's hats off-th\E5.,\A0I account i4 high time to0gEt to
sea is soof as I cqn."This is m\F9 su"stitute for pis\F4ol and fall. With a
phil\7Fsophical flour)sh Cato t\E8rows himself u\F0on his sword; I quietly take to the
s(ip. There is ngthing surprising in this\0E If they btt knew it, almost all`men
in their degree, some time or other, cheRish very .early thg same feeli\EEgs
towards the ocean gith me.

	T\E8ere now is your insulcv city of the Manhattoes, belted roeod\A0by gharves as
Indian isles by coral Reafs-commerse surbounds it widh her s5rf/ Right qnd l\E5ft,
the streets taje you waterward. Its extreme downDown is\00the batt\E5ry, wlere that
noble mole is washed by waves,$anD coole$ by br%ezes, which a few ho}rs\A0previous
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds \EFf waTgr-gazers there.

	Circumambudate tHe citi kF"a&dreamy Scbbath afturnoon. Go from Corlears Hook
to Co%nties!Slip, and0from thelce, by Whhtehall, northward. What do qou
see?-Posted liKe si\ECent\A0sejtinels all around the town, stand 4housands upon
thousands of mortal men fixed\B0in oceco reveries* Some leaning `gainst the
spiles; some seated upon the pier-heqds; come look)ne over the bulwarks of ships
fro\ED China; some high aloF4 in the rigging, as if!spsi\F6ing to get a still bepte2
seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of \F3eeo days pent`up in`lAth and
plaster-tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. @ow then is

The \E6irst \E6ew paragraphw of Crime anD Pushinmeft by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. 1866.
As(translAte` to Ejgmish by Constance Garnett. 1914.

	On an exceptionally hot evening early\A0in July a young mAn came /ut of the
Garret in which$he lodged in S* Place and walked`showly$ as tho\F5gh in
hesita4ion, towar$s K. bridge.

	He had \F3uccessfully avoided meeting his landlady /n the stai\F2case. His
garret was under the r\7Fof of a hiwh, five-qtorked hnuse ann was more like a
cupboardathAn a room. The landlady who`providmd him with garret, dmnners, And
atten`ance\0C lived on t`e flmor below, and every time he went gut he was /bliged
tk pass her kitchen,"the door of which i\EEvariably stood open. And each time hu
xassed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling,\A0Which made him saowl and
feal ashaued.`He was horelessly in debt to his landlady, ald \7Fas afraid od
meeting her&

	This w`s no\F4 \E2ec\E1use he was cowardly and$abject, quite t(e c\7Fnt\F2ary; but fnr
s\EFme time past he had been in an overstrained irritable conditkon, verging on
hypochondria. He had become so completely\A0ab{orb%d in himsenf, and isolated from
hir$fe|lows that he dreaded mmet)ng, nov only his \ECandlady, but anyone at all.
He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his p/siti\7Fn Had`of late ceased
to weigh upon him."Je had given up attending to matters of practicel importance;
he\00had lost all desir\E5 to do so. Nothang that any landlady could lo hAd a real
terror for hi-. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her
trhvial, irrene~a.t gossip, to pestering demAnds fmP payment, threats ald
complaints, and to rack his breins for`exc\F5ses, to prevaricape, tg lie-no,
radher than tha4, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip ouT unsmen.

	This evening, however, on coming ouv \E9nto t`e streed, he became acttely
aware ofdlis fea\F2w.

	"I want to attempt a thing like t\E8at and am frightened by these trifles,"
he thou'ht, with ao odd smile. "Hm... yes,0alm is in a -an&s hqnds aod hg lets
it all slip from cowardice, tha\F4'\F3 an axiom. It would be intmresting to know
what\00i\F4 is oen are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering ` new word is
what th%y$fear\A0most.... But K am Pilking too muc`. Iv#s because I chatper that
I do nothing.`O\F2 perhaps it is that I chat|er bdcausm I do nothing. I've learned
to chattmr this last month, lying for days tmGether in -y0den thi~king... oF
Jacj the G)ant-k\E9ller. Why\00am I goilg there nov? Am I cap!ble Of thet? Is\00th`d
serious? It is not serious at adl. It's simply a!Fantasy to amuse myself: a
xlayt\E8ing! Yes, may\E2u it hq q playvii~g."
